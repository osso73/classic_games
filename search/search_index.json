It is pretty simple: given a word (where you can only see its length), you have to guess it by proposing letters: Every letter proposed that exists in the word will appear in its correct position. Every letter proposed that does not exist will contribute to building your gallows. If you guess all letters, you win. If the gallows is finished before gessing all letters, you loose and you are hanged. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in several areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions desert picture : this is where your gallows will start to build red strip : the missed letters will show up here green strip : this will show the word being guessed. The letters that have not been guessed yet are shown as '-'. bottom : this is a keyboard, with a spanish layout (i.e. showing letter \u00d1 ). Note that keys are alphabetically sorted. Buttons in toolbar The buttons give you access to the following functions: Nuevo : to start a new game. It will erase whatever is on the screen, and provide a new word and reset the keyboard. Pista : this will give you a hint, i.e. show you one of the missing letters. You can only use this once in a game. Teclado : it allows you to change the skin of your keyboard. Several skins are provided. By pressing the button you cycle through them. Hombre : it allows you to change the picture of the man being hanged. Two different pictures are provided. Salir : exit the app. Other resources Under folder resources you can find additional files that I used to design and build the app. This folder is excluded from buildozer config. esquema.drawio : this is a diagram to help structure the screen, and the different parts. ahorcado.kv files: these are copies of the different men I had. The original was with strokes (i.e. no real picture). cuerda.png : was used to create the icon and splash screen for the game. generar_palabras.py : small python script that will take a file as input, and will create a list of words. I've used as input the file called spanish_book.txt. You can use whatever book, or list of words that you want to use as source. The program will find individual words, put them to uppercase, remove any accents and punctuation, and duplicates, and create a list, that can be used by the main.py program. spanish_book.txt : this is a book in Spanish, taken from Project Guttenberg Credits The images I used for this game (e.g. desert picture, the rope, the men) I found them over internet, by searching images. No particular copyright or limitation provided. The keys from the keyboard I found in Perfect Icons website, and also I built some others from sets that I found on Internet.

Each image is in two cards. You have to turn the cards, 2 each time, and then: if they show the same image, you guessed one pair, and the cards remain up. if they show different images, the cards will turn down again after 2 seconds, giving you some time to memorize their position. Each time you turn a pair of cards, the moves score is incremented by one. The goal is to find all the pairs, with the minimum number of moves. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in two areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions. playing ground : this is where the cards are. Buttons in toolbar The buttons give you access to the following functions: Nuevo : to start a new game. It will reset the score, and regenerate the images, using the defined set and number of pairs. Note that even if the set is the same as previous game, the images can be different, as they are picked randomly from a larger set of images. Topic : to change the topic used. The text of second button actually is the name of the topic. This will pick images from that particular topic. A number of topics are provided. Parejas : it shows the number of pairs to be created, when you next click the Nuevo button. This means you will have the double of cards (e.g. 6 pairs means you play with 12 cards). Use the buttons to increase/decrease this number. Movimientos : this is not a button, but you see here the number of moves you have made in this game. It is the score. The goal being to have as little as possible, i.e. to guess all the pairs with as few moves as possible.
