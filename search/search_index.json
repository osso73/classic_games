The image below shows an example of such a puzzle (almost solved): The game offers different levels of difficulty (3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 game), and different themes besides the classical numbers: each theme is a square image, that has been cut into pieces (see below Other resources for info how to create a new theme). You move the tiles by touching a tile adjacent to the empty space. This tile will move then to the empty space. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in several areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions, and give the score. main square : this is where you have the tiles that you need to move, to complete the picture. They are randomly sorted at the beginning. bottom : here is where you choose the theme and level. You can see an example of the current theme image complete below. This is to be used for reference, especially important in more difficult games (e.g. 4x4 and 5x5). The buttons allow you to change the level and the theme. Several themes are provided, the buttom will cycle through them. Buttons in toolbar The buttons give you access to the following functions: Nuevo : to start a new game. It will reset the score of movimientos, and start a new board with tiles randomly ordered, using the current theme and level. Movimientos : this is just a level (e.g. no button), it shows the current number of moves you made. This is the score, the higher the worse. The goal is to achieve a complete image with the minimum number of moves. X : exit the app. On the bottom toolbar, you find 2 buttons: Nivel n : this is to change the level. Level 1 is a board of 3x3, level 2 a board of 4x4, and level 3 a board of 5x5. Theme : this is to change the theme. The theme button will show the name of the theme, cycling through all available themes. By default, you start with the numbers. Solvable puzzles Note that not all puzzles of this kind (e.g. a puzzle of n x n squares with an empty space, randomly sorted) can be solved. I quickly realized that when I was doing the first tests. Fortunately, there is a way to find if a particular puzzle is solved, as explained in this page: How to check if an instance of 15 puzzle is solvable? . So I implemented a function based on this methodology to find if the puzzle that was randomly sorted was solvable; if not, I shuffle again and test again. This way I can ensure that all puzzles are solvable. Other resources Under folder resources you can find additional files that I used to design and build the app. This folder is excluded from buildozer config. esquemas.drawio : diagrams to help identify how to identify tiles adjacent to the empty space. creacion_temas : this folder contains a couple of scripts I created to create new themes from a square image: cut_image.py: will take a single image (to be provided in the command line) and will cut it into pieces of 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, each of the sets under a folder named 3, 4, and 5 respectively. cut_images.py: this will do the same process for all the images found in the directory. It will first create a folder with the same name as the image, move the image there, and cut it into different sets as described.

The objective of the game is to discover all the pairs of cards with the same image. At each turn, you flip 2 cards to show their image, and then: if they show the same image, you guessed one pair, and the cards remain up. if they show different images, the cards will turn down again after 2 seconds, giving you some time to memorize their position.

The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. (extracted from Wikipedia) Each turn you can move all tiles in one of the 4 directions: up, down, left or right. All tiles move in that direction as much as possible, until they find the edge of the board or another tile. In case they find another tile of the same value, the two tiles will merge and create a tile of double value. At each move, one new tile appears at any point of the board. The goal of the game is to have one tile of 2048 value. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in several areas: toolbar : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions (see below) 2048 button : clicking this button you can change the score required to win.

Use the button on the toolbar to enter in mode \"flag\", so when you click it will flag the area instead of uncovering. You can flag and unflag the area as many times as you want; but when you uncover the area, it remains uncovered. The size of the field depends on the level chosen through the toolbar button. See below how to change the level. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in three areas: toolbar : at the top. It contains some buttons to control behaviour of the game. See below for more details. playing ground : at the bottom of the screen. This is the minefield, where all the action happens. status row : between the toolbar and the minefield. It has some indicators, and the smiley. Left indicator is the number of mines left (i.e. each flag will you put decrease this number). The right indicator is the amount of seconds used. The smiley in the middle indicates the status of the game: smiling face is the standard wounded face when bomb explodes (e.g. you uncover a bomb).

There are many variants of the game. In here, the player controls a snake that goes on the screen. There is a piece of food at a random location of the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows the length, and a new piece of food appears (note that each type of food will have slightly different effects). The player has to avoid that the snake hits a wall or its own body: this will kill the snake. Reaching the end of the screen will not kill the snake, it will just pop up at the opposite end. The game has different levels, each of them has a certain amount of walls that the snake has to avoid. Once you reach a partial score of the level (which depends on the grid size), you move to the next level. Swipe on the screen to change the direction of the snake. The snake can turn 90 degrees in any direction. The screen can be either portrait or landscape. If the screen changes, you should start a new game to take the dimensions into account.

It is divided in three areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions, described in section Buttons in toolbar . results row : display the score and the current level, and a progress bar below to show the progress of the current level. When the progress bar reaches 100%, you move to the next level. playing ground : this is where the snake will run. Here you can see as well the current score of the game, which is the number of fruits you have eaten. Types of food There are different types of food, and when eating them you will see a different behaviour: Type Behaviour Examples Fruit Adds one snake part, and 2 points to the score. This is the healthy food! Fast-food Increases the speed of the snake by 50% for a while, adds 2 snake parts, and one point of score Sweet adds 3 parts of the snake, one point of score. Fruit is what you get most often. But watch out when eating other food, as you will suffer the consequences!

Once you reach a partial score of the level (which depends on the grid size), you move to the next level. Swipe on the screen to change the direction of the snake. The snake can turn 90 degrees in any direction. The screen can be either portrait or landscape. If the screen changes, you should start a new game to take the dimensions into account. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in three areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions, described in section Buttons in toolbar . results row : display the score and the current level, with a progress bar on the level. When the progress bar reaches 100%, you move to the next level. playing ground : this is where the snake will run. Here you can see as well the current score of the game, which is the number of fruits you have eaten. Types of food Latest version has introduced different types of food. There are 3 types with different behaviour: Type Behaviour Examples Fruit Adds one snake part, and 2 points to the score. This is the healthy food! Fast-food Increases the speed of the snake by 50% for a while, adds 2 snake parts, and one point of score Sweet adds 3 parts of the snake, one point of score. Fruit is what you get most often. But watch out when eating other food, as you will suffer the consequences! Buttons in toolbar The buttons give you access to the following functions: Start : to start a new game. It will reset the score, and remove the snake and food. It will create a new snake with the head only, and spawn a new food. / : mute the sounds of the game. Another click will unmmute. / : this button will pause the game. Another click will continue the game where it was. : open the Settings panel, to configure the options of the game. See the section Settings for details : open a webpage with the instructions on how to play the game (this manual you are reading). : exit the app. Settings All settings are grouped under a settings panel, as shown in this screenshot, and can be accessed through the menu button : Size : to change the size of the head and food. They can be larger or smaller. You can select from a number of pre-defined sizes: 11, 15, 19, 23. This is the number of squares that has the shortest side of the window. So the higher the number, the smaller the square will be, and hence the smaller the snake parts and food. Speed : to change the speed of the snake. You can select from a number of pre-defined speed factors: 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 3. The game starts with a factor of 1 by default. The factor will be dividing the interval between updates of the game. Therefore, the higher the factor the smaller is the interval between updates, producing a higher speed. Play story : this flag allows you to select the game mode: True to play in story mode, or False to play only one level. Story mode will start at the level selected below, and single-level will play the selected level endless. Start level : You can select the level to start your story, from 1 to 12. If the game mode is single-level, this will be the level you play; if the game mode is story, you will start at this level. The settings are saved, so next time you start the game it will maintain the same settings defined. Credits For the icons in the menubar I'm using Material Design icons . I found the snake head in here . And the images for food are from Perfect Icons website. These images cannot be used for commercial purposes, otherwise they are free for personal use.

There are many variants of the game. In here, the player controls a snake that goes on the screen. There is a piece of food at a random location of the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows the length, and a new piece of food appears (note that each type of food will have slightly different effects).
