The image below shows an example of such a puzzle (almost solved): The game offers different levels of difficulty (3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 game), and different themes besides the classical numbers: each theme is a square image, that has been cut into pieces (see below Other resources for info how to create a new theme). You move the tiles by touching a tile adjacent to the empty space. This tile will move then to the empty space. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in several areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions, and give the score. main square : this is where you have the tiles that you need to move, to complete the picture. They are randomly sorted at the beginning. bottom : here is where you choose the theme and level. You can see an example of the current theme image complete below. This is to be used for reference, especially important in more difficult games (e.g. 4x4 and 5x5). The buttons allow you to change the level and the theme. Several themes are provided, the buttom will cycle through them. Buttons in toolbar The buttons give you access to the following functions: Nuevo : to start a new game. It will reset the score of movimientos, and start a new board with tiles randomly ordered, using the current theme and level. Movimientos : this is just a level (e.g. no button), it shows the current number of moves you made. This is the score, the higher the worse. The goal is to achieve a complete image with the minimum number of moves. X : exit the app. On the bottom toolbar, you find 2 buttons: Nivel n : this is to change the level. Level 1 is a board of 3x3, level 2 a board of 4x4, and level 3 a board of 5x5. Theme : this is to change the theme. The theme button will show the name of the theme, cycling through all available themes. By default, you start with the numbers. Solvable puzzles Note that not all puzzles of this kind (e.g. a puzzle of n x n squares with an empty space, randomly sorted) can be solved. I quickly realized that when I was doing the first tests. Fortunately, there is a way to find if a particular puzzle is solved, as explained in this page: How to check if an instance of 15 puzzle is solvable? . So I implemented a function based on this methodology to find if the puzzle that was randomly sorted was solvable; if not, I shuffle again and test again. This way I can ensure that all puzzles are solvable.

(extracted from Wikipedia) Each turn you can move all tiles in one of the 4 directions: up, down, left or right. All tiles move in that direction as much as possible, until they find the edge of the board or another tile. In case they find another tile of the same value, the two tiles will merge and create a tile of double value. At each move, one new tile appears at any point of the board.

This was my first app, I followed the tutorial from Kivy website , and added some functionality in terms of changing skin, etc. Rules are pretty simple: two-player game, each player has a paddle and needs to use it to avoid that the ball touches his edge of the screen. The ball speeds up at each bounce. If you miss the ball, your opponent gets a point. Game ends at 5 points.","title":"Rules of the game"},{"location":"games/pong/#main-screen","text":"This is the main screen of the game.

There are many variants of the game. In here, the player controls a snake that goes on the screen. There is a piece of food in a random location of the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows the length by one unit, and a new piece of food appears. The player has to avoid that the snake hits the extreme of the screen, or the body of the snake: this will kill the snake. Turning the snake can be done by swiping on the screen. The snake can turn 90 degrees in any direction. The screen can be either portrait or landscape. If the screen changes, you should start a new game to take the dimensions into account. Main screen This is the main screen of the game. It is divided in two areas: top row : it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions. playing ground : this is where the snake will run. Here you can see as well the current score of the game, which is the number of fruits you have eaten. Buttons in toolbar The buttons give you access to the following functions: Start : to start a new game. It will reset the score, and remove the snake and food. It will create a new snake with the head only, and spawn a new food. Size : to change the size of the head and food. They can be larger or smaller. At each click it will switch to the next size. You can cycle through a number of pre-defined sizes: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. This is the number of squares that has the shortest side of the window. So the higher the number, the smaller the square will be, and hence the smaller the snake parts and food. Speed : to change the speed of the snake. At each click it will switch to the next speed factor, varying from: 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 3. The game starts with a factor of 1 by default. The factor will be dividing the interval between updates of the game. Therefore, the higher the factor the smaller is the interval between updates, producing a higher speed. : open a webpage with the instructions on how to play the game (this manual you are reading). : exit the app. Credits I found the snake head in here .
