# Snake

## Rules of the game

Very classic game, exists in most of the platforms, one of the first games ever built on a phone (old Nokia phones). There are many variants of the game.

In here, the player controls a snake that goes on the screen. There is a piece of food in a random location of the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows the length by one unit, and a new piece of food appears. The player has to avoid that the snake hits the extreme of the screen, or the body of the snake: this will kill the snake.

Turning the snake can be done by swiping on the screen. The snake can turn 90 degrees in any direction.


## Main screen

This is the main screen of the game.

For now it's very simple, just the snake and the food.


## Buttons in toolbar

None yet. To be developed in further versions.
