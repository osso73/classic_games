# 2048

_under development -- this page contains internal notes for the development of the game_

## Rules of the game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

_(extracted from Wikipedia)_

Each turn you can move all tiles in one of the 4 directions: up, down, left or right. All tiles move in that direction as much as possible, until they find the edge of the board or another tile. In case they find another tile of the same value, the two tiles will merge and create a tile of double value. At each move, one new tile appears at any point of the board. The goal of the game is to have one tile of 2048 value.

An example of the original board is shown here:

> Internal notes:
> - Use animation functions to make the buttons move, this is very important.
> - need to identify the exact colours of the tiles, to be as close as the original
> - not sure if I want to have different sizes (4x4 is the best compromise).
> - add "joystick-like" controls to move the tiles. Need to look for the right image




## Main screen

This is the main screen of the game.

![screenshot](../img/2048_screen.jpg)

It is divided in several areas:

- _top row_: it shows a toolbar with some buttons that will allow you different functions, and give the score.

- _main square_: this is where you have the tiles that you need to move, to complete the picture. They are randomly sorted at the beginning.

- _bottom_: here is where you choose the theme and level. You can see an example of the current theme image complete below. This is to be used for reference, especially important in more difficult games (e.g. 4x4 and 5x5). The buttons allow you to change the level and the theme. Several themes are provided, the buttom will cycle through them.


## Buttons in toolbar

The buttons give you access to the following functions:

  - **Nuevo**: to start a new game. It will reset the score of movimientos, and start a new board with tiles randomly ordered, using the current theme and level.

  - **Movimientos**: this is just a level (e.g. no button), it shows the current number of moves you made. This is the score, the higher the worse. The goal is to achieve a complete image with the minimum number of moves.

  - **X**: exit the app.

On the bottom toolbar, you find 2 buttons:

- **Nivel n**: this is to change the level. Level 1 is a board of 3x3, level 2 a board of 4x4, and level 3 a board of 5x5.

- **Theme**: this is to change the theme. The theme button will show the name of the theme, cycling through all available themes. By default, you start with the numbers.


## Other resources

Under folder `resources` you can find additional files that I used to design and build the app. This folder is excluded from `buildozer` config.

- _esquemas.drawio_: diagrams to help identify how to identify tiles adjacent to the empty space.

- _creacion_temas_: this folder contains a couple of scripts I created to create new themes from a square image:
  - cut_image.py: will take a single image (to be provided in the command line) and will cut it into pieces of 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, each of the sets under a folder named 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
  - cut_images.py: this will do the same process for all the images found in the directory. It will first create a folder with the same name as the image, move the image there, and cut it into different sets as described.
