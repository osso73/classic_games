# Ahorcado changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). For the version numbers, I just use a simple 2-digit, for major and minor changes. Each version has its corresponding apk under the folder `releases`.


## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Hint button in ahorcado, if clicked when game is not happening, it hanged the game. Now this is fixed, as per iss. #75.
