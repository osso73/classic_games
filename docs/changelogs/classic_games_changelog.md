# Classic games changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). For the version numbers, I just use a simple 2-digit, for major and minor changes. Each version has its corresponding apk under the folder `releases`.


## v0.1 2021-05-23

Initial version of the app. It includes the main menu with the navigation and the snake game with the settings. All the other games are not yet implemented.

### Added:
- Initial version of the menu and navigation
- Game of snake implemented. Still using many elements from kivy.
